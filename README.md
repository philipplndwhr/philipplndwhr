Most of my GitHub commits are @Musescore issues, public transport & data analysis related or belong to the optical design library [_doptics_](https://github.com/philipplndwhr/doptics)!

I am a German mathematics student with a background in data analysis for public transportation providers. My research interest lies in stochastics, public transportation (especially delay modelling) and inverse methods in optical design.

- 👋 Hi, I’m @philipplndwhr. 
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis and visualization, especially in public transportation data analysis. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Dash & Plotly python library, getting deeper into pandas and numpy than ever before 
- 💞️ I’m looking for collaborators with a some experience and understanding of Cython or embedding Fortran code in Python to help accelerating the _doptics_ library.
